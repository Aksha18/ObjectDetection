Faster R-CNN Object Detection Model
Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and training of a Faster R-CNN model for object detection. The model is designed for detecting objects in images and can be used for various applications such as image classification, object localization, and more. The model is built using TensorFlow and has been trained on a custom dataset, targeting the detection of three object classes.


Key Features
Object Detection: Detects objects within images and predicts their bounding boxes along with the associated class and confidence score.
Model Architecture: Built using Faster R-CNN with the Inception V2 backbone, which is known for its effectiveness in object detection tasks.
Training: The model was trained on a custom dataset, with fine-tuning from a pre-trained model for faster convergence.
